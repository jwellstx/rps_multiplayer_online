A fun game of rock, paper scissors with a chat app enabled! Play with your friends to see who is the better player while chatting with each other.  You get to pick your own name too! There is even a spectator mode!

Some challenges faced included how to display the page based on who was player 1, player 2 or a spectator.  Another challenge was how to determine when a player had left then page and how to handle resetting the game.  It was an exciting game to code which as included new functionality using the firebase realtime databases.
